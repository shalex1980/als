  "The most effective content is supported and validated by positive reviews."
      This one is about social proof. Product reviews, both the quantity of them and the quality, are huge
  influencers on if people are going to buy a product. Many people compare products not only on
  Amazon is based on reviews, but they will even pull up their phone and check Amazon reviews before they
  buy the product in store. That is a big thing companies should be aware of! So, reviews are important.
  We firmly believe that all reviews should be monitored and responded to. This shows a level of care, and
  a strong review follow-up system can be used to curtail the accumulation of poor reviews.
  We can further increase the review score by going through and requesting removal for feedback that
  doesn't follow the Amazon guidelines. Typically, these types of reviews are related to product
  fulfillment and are a violation of Amazon's review guidelines.
